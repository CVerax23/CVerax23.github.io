  <h2>Week-3- CSS:</h2>
  <p>This stuff is getting hard. CSS is freaking awesome. Wish I could time-box better. This is the week to figure that out damn it! Also, I just needed maybe an hour or two more to get things looking real nice with my images, but the time-box restrictions left me with what you are currently viewing. </p>

  <h2>Week-4:Arrays & Hashes</h2>
  <p>So we get to Ruby finally....and we meet our friends, the indexed collections: Arrays and Hashes. They aren't the funnest off pals, in fact, they're a bit annoying and confusing, but they're our friends, so we of course, still put up with them.

  But that doesn't mean we don't gossip about them behind their backs... :)

  Like for instance, Hashes is definitely a better friend than Arrays when it comes to their keys, Arrays only allow for integer values regarding keys, whereas Hashes allow for any object to be a key. It's more efficient to access array elements, but hashes provide more flexibility. So how do we decide which friend we like more and want to associate with in our code. I think a few simple points help us make that decision. Namely these two questions:

        1. Does our data need to correlate to a specific label? If yes, we pick Hashes.
        2. Does order matter? If yes, we could go either way, however typically Arrays are who we chill with if order is of concern, this is because Hashes would often lose their order in older versions of Ruby, and you always go with the friend you can rely on. 

  If those two questions are a toss up, I'd be friends with Hash. For numerous other, "extra-curricular" reasons. LOL. 

  And on that note, this "Mean Girls" style blog entry, be out....
