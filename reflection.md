1.What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

CSS padding properties define the space between the element border and the element content. Border properties allow you to specify the style and color of an elementâ€™s border. Margin properties define the space around elements. The margin clears an area around an element (outside the border). The margin does not have a background color, and is completely transparent.


2.What did you learn about CSS positioning?

The position property specifies the type of positioning method used for an element, the default position is static for html elements, which means they are not affected by top, bottom, left and right proprties.


3.What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I found the footer easiest LOL. Everything else was hard because there are so many different ways to institute the effect, finding the correct, most efficent one becomes diffcult. Namely I had this problem with styling each section.


4.What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

That elements should be added using external style sheets in order for the entire set of pages to have a harmony in appearnace. For more specific style effects, the use of id and class is required, but I still haven't grasped it all completley.
