How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

I actually was able to complete this module with my previous cohort, and I reallty enjoyed wireframing with that pair partner.

Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

Not exactly, it was a cumbersome step that I felt when working alone wasn't very necessary, however for collborative work I can absolutey see its value.

What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

Being clear, concise and guiding the UI experience in a seamless fashion.

What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any)?

<aritcle> was one of the main ones, along w/ the <nav>
  We learned article because it was reccomended as the best to use with Blog Posts, which were the focus of this module.
