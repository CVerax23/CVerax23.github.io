  <h2>Week-3- CSS:</h2>
  <p>This stuff is getting hard. CSS is freaking awesome. Wish I could time-box better. This is the week to figure that out damn it! Also, I just needed maybe an hour or two more to get things looking real nice with my images, but the time-box restrictions left me with what you are currently viewing. </p>

  <h2>Week-4:Arrays & Hashes</h2>
  <p>So we get to Ruby finally....and we meet our friends, the indexed collections: Arrays and Hashes. They aren't the funnest off pals, in fact, they're a bit annoying and confusing, but they're our friends, so we of course, still put up with them.

  But that doesn't mean we don't gossip about them behind their backs... :)

  Like for instance, Hashes is definitely a better friend than Arrays when it comes to their keys, Arrays only allow for integer values regarding keys, whereas Hashes allow for any object to be a key. It's more efficient to access array elements, but hashes provide more flexibility. So how do we decide which friend we like more and want to associate with in our code. I think a few simple points help us make that decision. Namely these two questions:

        1. Does our data need to correlate to a specific label? If yes, we pick Hashes.
        2. Does order matter? If yes, we could go either way, however typically Arrays are who we chill with if order is of concern, this is because Hashes would often lose their order in older versions of Ruby, and you always go with the friend you can rely on. 

  If those two questions are a toss up, I'd be friends with Hash. For numerous other, "extra-curricular" reasons. LOL. 

  And on that note, this "Mean Girls" style blog entry, be out....

  <h2>Week-5:Enumerable#cycle</h2>
  <p>When used on an array and a block is provided, cycle passes each item to the block. Once the last array item has been passed to the block, cycle starts over again at the beginning of the array. cycle goes through the array forever unless it encounters a break statement in the block. Essentially, the enumerable "Mixin" provides collection classes with several traversal and searching methods, and with the ability to sort. The class must provide a method each, which yields successive members of the collection. To put it in the simplest possible way: Given a collection, creates an infinitely-repeating ordered source of its items.</p>

  <h2>Week-8:</h2>
  <p>There are two roads to accomplish excellent security. On one you would assign all of the resources needed to maintain constant alert to new security issues. You would ensure that all patches and updates are done at once, have all of your existing applications reviewed for correct security, ensure that only security knowledgeable programmers do work on your site and have their work checked carefully by security professionals. You would also maintain a tight firewall, antivirus protection and run IPS/IDS.Your other option: use a web scanning solution to test your existing equipment, applications and web site code to see if a KNOWN vulnerability actually exists. While firewalls, antivirus and IPS/IDS are all worthwhile, it is simple logic to also lock the front door. It is far more effective to repair a half dozen actual risks than it is to leave them in place and try to build higher and higher walls around them. Network and web site vulnerability scanning is the most efficient security investment of all.If one had to walk just one of these roads, diligent wall building or vulnerability testing, it has been seen that web scanning will actually produce a higher level of web security on a dollar for dollar basis. This is proven by the number of well defended web sites which get hacked every month, and the much lower number of properly scanned web sites which have been compromised.</p>
